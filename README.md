# Secret Santa App

## Overview

- The aim of this app is to facilitate a Secret Santa gift exchange by matching each participant's name with a different name.
- Developed using a hashmap class, this project incorporates programming concepts learned in a university class, including hashmaps, circular indices, and frontend/backend development.
- JUnit tests ensure the expected output, validating the effectiveness of the implemented solution.

## How it Works

- The app prompts the user for the number of participants in the Secret Santa gift exchange.
- User inputs the names of each participant.
- The app sequentially assigns each user a different name, ensuring no one is matched with themselves.
- If a self-match occurs, the entire process restarts.
- Name pairs are stored in a hashmap to track assignments and avoid duplicates.
- Options for file output are provided in the code to keep the names confidential.

### Purpose and Focus

- Developed as a solution to the challenges of assigning names for a Secret Santa gift exchange.
- Focus on utilizing hashmaps, circular indices, and frontend/backend development concepts learned in the CS 400 class (Fall 2023).
- JUnit tests verify the functionality and correctness of the solution.

## Usage

- Users can run the app to manage the Secret Santa assignment process.
- File output and potential SMS options in the code ensure confidentiality of the names.
- Future plans include creating an executable desktop app for broader accessibility without coding knowledge.
